Proposal creation:

How it works:
The user clicks on create proposal.
He adds in the title and the description
The proposal creator can also attach files (just the documents and imgs - .png, .jpg, .pdf, .docx, .xlxs
The start date is automatically set at the time the user opens the proposal creation page and the end date is 5 days after the start date.
When he clicks Create proposal, he will need to sign it on the blockchain because the proposals are also created through soroban smart contract.

Automatically analyzing DAO participation, token balance, and wallet activity to calculate voting power

For this task, please refer to this link


Displaying the voting power calculation publicly for every proposal.

There are going to be 2 sections, Total voting power of all the people who votes YES and total voting power for NO. The calculation for each vote will be displayed publicly.

The voting is also done through smart contract.

Development of "Top Voters" feature

There’s a widget for Top Voters on the right of DAO page. It will display the list of DAO members that are most active on DAO’s activity. For example (how many proposals that have voted, how many comments on proposals, how many created proposals.

NOTE: Members can only comment on the proposal after they’ve voted. This means that the comment button will only become active once that’ve voted on the proposal.



LumosDAO Voting Power
Calculation Documentation
Introduction
This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding how the Voting Power
is calculated in the LumosDAO ecosystem. The Voting Power is a significant metric as it
influences the weight of a member's vote in any proposal within a DAO. The maximum voting
power that a vote can carry is 5. It is calculated based on three primary factors:
● Token Holdings
● DAO Activity
● Wallet Metrics
Voting Power Formula
The Voting Power (VP) for any member is calculated using the following weighted formula:
VP = (0.5 * Token Holdings Score) + (0.25 * DAO Activity Sub-score) + (0.25 * Wallet
Metrics Sub-score)
Scoring System
Token Holdings Score (1-5)
The score is assigned based on the member's ranking among the DAO's token holders:
● Top 5 holders: Score = 5
● Rank 6-50: Score = 4
● Rank 51-100: Score = 3
● Rank 101-500: Score = 2
● Rank 500+: Score = 1
DAO Activity Score (1-5 for each metric)
Number of Voted Proposals:
● 0 proposals: Score = 1
● 1-5 proposals: Score = 2
● 6-25 proposals: Score = 3
● 26-50 proposals: Score = 4
● 50+ proposals: Score = 5
Number of Comments on Proposals:
● 0 comments: Score = 1
● 1-25 comments: Score = 2
● 26-100 comments: Score = 3
● 101-500 comments: Score = 4
● 500+ comments: Score = 5
Wallet Metrics Score (1-5 for each metric)
Account Age:
● Less than 1 month: Score = 1
● 1-6 months: Score = 2
● 6-12 months: Score = 3
● 1-2 years: Score = 4
● 2+ years: Score = 5
Account Balance (in USD):
● $0-$50: Score = 1
● $51-$100: Score = 2
● $101-$500: Score = 3
● $501-$1000: Score = 4
● $1000+: Score = 5
Number of Trades:
● No trades: Score = 1
● 1-100 trades: Score = 2
● 101-500 trades: Score = 3
● 501-1000 trades: Score = 4
● 1000+ trades: Score = 5
Example Calculations:
Patrick:
Token Holdings Score:
● Patrick is holder number 30, so his score is 4 (falls in the 6-50 range).
DAO Activity Scores:
● Voted on 2 proposals: Score = 2 (falls in the 1-5 proposals range).
● Made 4 comments on proposals: Score = 2 (falls in the 1-25
comments range).
Wallet Metrics Scores:
● Account age: 2 months old = Score 2 (falls in the 1-6 months range).
● Account balance: $40 = Score 1 (falls in the $0-$50 range).
● Number of trades: 15 trades = Score 2 (falls in the 1-100 trades
range).
DAO Activity Sub-score:
(2 (for voting) + 2 (for comments)) / 2 = 2
Wallet Metrics Sub-score: (2 (for age) + 1 (for balance) + 2 (for trades)) / 3
= 5 / 3 ≈ 1.67
Voting Power for Patrick: 0.5 × 4 (Token Holding) + 0.25 × 2 (DAO
Activity) + 0.25 × 1.67 (Wallet Metrics)
Voting Power for Patrick: 2 + 0.5 + 0.4175 = 2.9175
Sam:
Token Holdings Score:
● Sam is holder number 2, so his score is 5 (falls in the Top 5 holders
range).
DAO Activity Scores:
● Voted on 0 proposals: Score = 1 (falls in the 0 proposals range).
● Made 2 comments on proposals: Score = 2 (falls in the 1-25
comments range)
Wallet Metrics Scores:
● Account age: 3 months old = Score 2 (falls in the 1-6 months range).
● Account balance: $0 = Score 1 (falls in the $0-$50 range).
● Number of trades: 3 trades = Score 2 (falls in the 1-100 trades
range).
DAO Activity Sub-score: (1 (for voting) + 2 (for comments)) / 2 = 1.5
Wallet Metrics Sub-score: (2 (for age) + 1 (for balance) + 2 (for trades)) / 3
= 5 / 3 ≈ 1.67
Voting Power for Sam: 0.5 × 5 (Token Holding) + 0.25 × 1.5 (DAO
Activity) + 0.25 × 1.67 (Wallet Metrics)
Voting Power for Sam: 2.5 + 0.375 + 0.4175 = 3.2925
